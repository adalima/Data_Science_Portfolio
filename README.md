<sub>Administrator, consultant in projects and processes at infinity Consultoria ltda</sub>

My credentials include a career developed over 20 years in the Administrative, IT, Project / Process Management and University Teaching areas, with extensive experience distributed in these areas, which enabled me to develop a differentiated holistic view, considering the public and private organizational contexts. These skills provide me with maturity and adaptive versatility in relation to the various professional challenges that may arise, which combined with proactivity, focus on results and emotional intelligence, allow me to act in several areas of knowledge.

I participated in a restructuring project of renewal of the TV / data transmission infrastructure via cable in the USA of approximately one year, which provided me, in addition to knowledge, a rewarding cultural experience.

I am currently focused on strategic, project and process management, as well as IT, covering the various areas of knowledge and organizational environments, **and the development of knowledge in data science (my goal).**

**Background in:** Strategic, project and process management.
